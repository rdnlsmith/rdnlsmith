# Daniel Smith `@rdnlsmith`

Hi! I'm Daniel. I write software. (Mostly not on GitHub ðŸ˜•)

## Me as a developer

I maintain a [collection of Linux-friendly themes for VS Code](https://github.com/rdnlsmith/vscode-linux-themes).

I am comfortable with C#, SQL, and HTML; I'm _okay_ at CSS and JavaScript; on the more obscure end, I sometimes work with [Progress OpenEdge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenEdge_Advanced_Business_Language).

I love automating things, writing tools for my own workflow, and learning about the history of computing.

## Me as a human

I love computers, but I have other interests too!

I like to read books (mostly sci-fi), watch Netflix (mostly sci-fi), and play the occasional video game (especially turn-based strategy).

I used to play chess a lot, but not so much these days. I recently [played against a PDP-8](https://twitter.com/rdnlsmith/status/1184650467298537472?s=20)!

My newest hobby is [building model Gundams](https://twitter.com/rdnlsmith/status/1246901873136852994?s=20).
